## Short Description of The Picture

Me sitting on an indoor bench with the Korean heart symbol. I tagged various accounts such as [@BackdoorLA](https://www.instagram.com/backdoorla/?hl=en) and my friend Thao on the shoes and the heart symbol respectively.

## My Movites :wink:

My brother and his girlfriend got me shoes for my birthday, low-top Jordans. I wanted to tag his account [@BackdoorLA](https://www.instagram.com/backdoorla/?hl=en), and to do so, I had to post something on Instagram, so on the 27th, a Saturday, I went out to The Source with my friend, Kathy. We were checking out the K-Pop stores at The Source, since I was meeting up with my friend at Little Saigon later that night-I wanted to give him something. I bought him a Twice Lanyard. 

## PICTURE TAKING TIME!

Now onto how I actually got the picture taken. I was sitting on the white bench, which was under a TV and the Korean heart finger symbol. I told Kathy to take a picture and send it to me. She took the picture on Instagram Story, so the picture had to be resized to fit the shoe and my whole body. I didn’t know how to resize it, so I got her to resize it for me.

## MEETING UP WITH MY HOMEBOY FROM NORCAL

Later that night, at Little Saigon, after a long 20 minute drive down to Garden Grove, there were many people at the place and getting dropped off took forever because of the amount of cars there were. I met up with my boy, Thao, and told him to choose a good caption for me to post, and he told me to go with one of those Korean Emoticons. I also gave him his Twice Lanyard and Twice Keychain, he loved it. I for some reason also saw some people from school there such as Kristina, John, and Nhan. John tapped my on the shoulder and ran away while Thao and I were in line.

## TL;DR

Long story short, I wanted to post a picture on Instagram, so that I could tag [@BackdoorLA](https://www.instagram.com/backdoorla/?hl=en). I wanted to take a picture that was lowkey K-Pop related to subtly expose my love to Epik High, so I chose to sit under the Korean heart symbol at The Source. I wanted my followers to realize that I use social media, and that I’m not dead, which is another reason why I posted.
